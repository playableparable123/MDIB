	desc = "Former Governor of the State of California, and now acting president. Mice Curb has had a very tremendous effect on American politics. Under his leadership he was able to rally the united states into a unified framework. This has come at the cost of democratic elections and most of the presidents reputation. Despite his promises of returning elections soon, he still sits with overwhelmingly negative public approval rating of only 24% approval.

In the 80s to 90s, Curb managed to politically negotiate his way to the top of the United States as the country faced crisis after crisis. Even managing to hold California together when its central authority nearly crumbled. Despite his years of service, the public still views him as a despot who opportunistically seized power for himself. Despite what the public or congress thinks, Curb is hell bent on reforming the country and making America the globe spanning nation it always was meant to be. The shining beacon of liberty to a world still stuck with century old despots. "
