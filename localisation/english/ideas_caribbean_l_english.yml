 CNC_Pirate_Presidency: "Pirate Presidency"
 CNC_Pirate_Presidency_desc: "Despite being a sea-raiding, swamp-creeping, coke-pushing, and gun-toting network of loosely affiliated gangs, the Conch Republic stands under one banner, and considers itself a sovereign nation, with disgraced congressman-turned-outlaw Richard Kelly as their self-proclaimed 'President'. Awkward as the position may be, Kelly enjoys a rather lavish lifestyle in his tropical oval office, sitting back and cutting deals while pirates, mobsters, and gangsters handle all the real work."
 CNC_Clearwater_Connections: "Clearwater Connections"
 CNC_Clearwater_Connections_desc: "One of the major players in Concher politics is one Heber Jentzsch, president of the Church of Scientology's Southern Branch, and kingpin of the city of Clearwater, Florida. Since 1975. the Church has been steadily buying up land, paying off politicians, and establishing their 'Spiritual Headquarters' at Flag Land Base. Despite their religious kookery, the Sea Org has established firm relations with the Conch Republic, supporting their ilicit businesses and expanding the market from the Keys and Everglades up to Tampa and the north. One issue does present itself, however: Jentzch and his cronies are noted for their power hungry nature, and should the scales fall a certain way, they wouldn't be afraid to take the reigns... by force."
 FLO_Boiling_Over: "Boiling Over"
 FLO_Boiling_Over_desc: "Florida is a warzone. The incompetence of Governor Graham to solve basically anything in his decade of governorship has taken it's toll. The Islands and the Coast are awash with Secessionist pirates, Tampa and the Everglades are wrought with Meth-slinging bikers and hillbillies, Miami's police force has become a cartel of it's own, and the state government is beginning to rip apart at the seams. The Sunshine State's fate is on the horizon, and it's down to a series of backroom deals and backstreet shootouts to tell how things will end up."
 BAH_Whore_Of_The_Caribbean: "Whore of the Caribbean"
 BAH_Whore_Of_The_Caribbean_desc: "The Bahamas is a glorified tax haven for the degenerate kingpins of Miami and the grunts and goons of Pemberton to dump their cash and catch syphilis. It wasn't always like this, of course. Initially, the islands were simply another possession in the pockets of the British Empire, which quickly made their leave as their queen was taken out and the advent of Ephraim came. The Caribbean was considered a lost cause, leaving a litany of independence movements to make their mark. Lynden Pindling, First and Present Prime Minister, made his mark by choosing not to cast off the nation's shackles, but negotiate their loosening with the power-hungry invaders from the states. For every dollar earned, they're kept at bay, and Bahamian independence is secured."
