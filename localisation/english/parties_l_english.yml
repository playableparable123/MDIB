 anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchy"

 anarchism_id:0 "Anarchism"
 anarchism_id_desc:0 "As the first fires were lit millennia ago, so too did the sparks of co-operation fly. That singular chain of help, that echo of an echo of friendship from aeons past is what stands at the centre of all social connection. And then comes the tyrants, the presidents, those who claim to hold all in mutual respect, and yet scheme, and plot and throw us, the people into the fires of their own misbegotten and vain hopes. Anarchy, Order in Chaos, arises as the cure. Not a Godhead nor an Emperor to hold the populace in tow. Naught but the fire of co-operation, keeping us warm, an interminable link. A system that we finally control. Many hold the name of Anarchism in their hearts, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Siuda, Zapata... but none will be its face. For the Anarchist is one with the people, and the people shall be free."
 social_anarchism:0 "Social Anarchism"
 social_anarchism_desc:0 "Social anarchism is a branch of anarchism that emphasizes the relationship between liberty and social equality. It advocates for a social revolution aimed at dismantling oppressive hierarchies, such as capitalism and the state, and replacing them with cooperative and non-hierarchical forms of organization. Social anarchists champion mutual aid as a guiding principle for fostering social collaboration and building egalitarian communities. Rooted in the socialist tradition, the ideology draws heavily on the works of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, and Peter Kropotkin."
 religious_anarchism:0 "Religious Anarchism"
 religious_anarchism_desc:0 "Deviating from mainstream Anarchist movements, which tend to be Athiest or Anti-Theist in nature, Religious Anarchists devise their statelessness from alternative systems of theology and philosophy. Whether it be a monotheistic concept of God's rule over the rule of man, or a more deep-set, self-reflective philosophy like those of Buddhists or Daoists. Technically speaking, Religious Anarchism is the oldest school of Anarchy, with roots in the stateless societies of Shamanistic tribes and early sects of Islam and Christianity."
 individualist_anarchism:0 "Individualist Anarchism"
 individualist_anarchism_desc:0 "Individualist Anarchism emphasizes, as one might expect, the individual, both in theory and praxis. While not inherently repulsed by ideas of collective power or organization, proponents tend to put a spotlight on individual value, ingenuity, and power, valuing things like social independence, lone-wolf actions, or even an anarchist-tuned great man theory."
 mutualism:0 "Mutualism"
 mutualism_desc:0 "A unique variant of market anarchism, credited to French radical Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mutualism espouses the necessity of an artisan-worker-directed market economy and horizontal, voluntarian society. It holds a particular prejudice to what it calls 'coercive' property, with the slogan 'Property is Theft!'."
 market_anarchism:0 "Market Anarchism"
 market_anarchism_desc:0 "A left-leaning offshoot of the philosophy of Murray Rothbard and his variable predecessors, Market Anarchists take the radical and wild nature of Austrian Economics and free markets to the next level, as, without the iron arm of the state lifting up monopolistic hierarchies, what market would be any freer? Most Market Anarchists express their ideals through the act of Agorism, morally dubious 'Grey Market' trade for the perpetuation of state-free trade and commerce."
 anarcho_syndicalism:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism"
 anarcho_syndicalism_desc:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism is a branch of syndicalism that aims to create a truly anarchist society, without any of the traditional political or economic structures of mainline Syndicalism. Drawing from the theories of libertarian socialism and syndicalism, anarcho-syndicalists see trade unions as both a means to achieve immediate improvements to working conditions and as a tool to build towards social revolution in the form of a general strike, with the ultimate aim of abolishing both capitalism and the state. Anarcho-Syndicalism rejects political parties and participation in politics, and most consider orthodox Syndicalism to be a malevolent influence on the labor movement."
 creative_anarchism:0 "Creative Anarchism"
 creative_anarchism_desc:0 "One of anarchism's more unusual strains, Creative Anarchism combines the standard foundations of state abolition, free association, and mutual aid with a downright worship of the arts and their creation. Penned and painted from the treatises and manifestos of radical artisans, Creative Anarchism puts a pedestal on culture houses as it does local councils, idolizes musicians and sculptures as it does activists and revolutionaries (if they are to be considered separate at all), and draws a target on prestigious museums and art schools as it does royal palaces and corporate offices."

 transcendentalism:0 "Transcendentalism"
 transcendentalism_desc:0 ""Strip man down to their basics, and what drives them to do bad in this world? Is it the individual, or the environment that they inhabit? To some, the individual is to blame. To the Transcendentalist, it's the other way around. Inspired by the works of the Transcendental Club of Massachusetts, and that of key writers such as Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller, Transcendentalism aims to strip back the world around the individual to its very basics. It evokes a minimalistic, anti-consumerist lifestyle, railing against political parties, government entities or anything that might corrupt the over-soul of the individual. Only through self-reliance can true communities strive, and only through harmony with their surroundings can Transcendentalism survive"
 dissident_anarchism:0 "Dissident Anarchism"
 dissident_anarchism_desc:0 "The ultimate archetype of burning bright hatred, Dissident Anarchists are despised by their own kind, obeying no moral or societal hierarchy or norms. A broad category which can include anybody from raving white supremacist gangsters to psychotic bomb-crafting ecoterrorists to teenage dirtbags stockpiling guns in their basement. The spirit of rebellion for rebellion's sake unites these disparate souls, as they firmly force their mantra down the throat of any who may attempt to command them in the slightest; FUCK OFF."
 bandit_anarchism:0 "Bandit Anarchism"
 bandit_anarchism_desc:0 "No honor amongst thieves, and no rules amongst those that defy it. Ever since the Golden Age of Piracy has the interesting paradox of "bandit anarchism" cropped up. Evoked in the stories of Robin Hood and Captain Kid, preserved in the legends of Ned Kelly, Lampiao and Fonte, Bandit Anarchism subscribes to an organized, albeit loose confederation of do-as-thou-wilt "organizations" that, to certain descriptions, are 'bandits'. Whether they be criminal organization, loosely connected freedom fighters, biker clubs or guerrillas in the mist, the one thing that binds them is a devotion to communal and individual liberty, a willingness to use power to maintain their freedom and a relatively loose approach to definitions of legality."
 liberal_anarchism:0 "Liberal Anarchism"
 liberal_anarchism_desc:0 "With its origins in the French Revolution, Liberal Anarchism takes the ideals of the Lockean creed to their utmost extreme. The God given rights of man shall never be trampled by any state power, ever. Even with its historically significant background, however, the ideology remains rather fringe, kept afloat by Radical Liberal scholars and philosophy majors loyal to the doctrines of the founding fathers of the Enlightenment."
 mystical_anarchism:0 "Mystical Anarchism"
 mystical_anarchism_desc:0 "From the oldest schools of noble mystics in high temples down to the street edge of neoteric wannabe chaos magicians, Mystical Anarchism is the dark underpinning of the movement, it's adherents scheming and carrying out their methods of liberation through ritualistic direct action. Culture-jamming, Esoterrorism, Temporary Autonomous Zones, or the simplest surrealist act as put by André Breton, all are viable methods to the agents of Eris."
 panarchism:0 "Panarchism"
 panarchism_desc:0 "Inspired by the writings of Belgian social scientist Paul Émile de Puydt, Panarchism advocates a system of completely voluntary governance, or more often, non-governance. Conflict is settled in systems of polycentric law, with third party free courts settling disputes. Advocates of Panarchy are closely related to the New Right and Propertarians, as they share a belief in societies of thousands of small-scale self-managed communities functioning off of Voluntarist ethics."
 stateless_society:0 "Stateless Society"
 stateless_society_desc:0 "The truest form of anarchism there could be, a Stateless Society is a large area that lacks an overall state or government and instead is a disconnected patchwork of tribes, communities and other organizations. While disinterested in any governmental matter, these "stateless entities" do still share a common language, culture and even tribal heriarchy, however that is where the discussion stops. All manner of decisions are left solely in the hands of the various tribes, and through a disinterest in the concept of modern government, elects to leave it at that."

 marxism_id:0 "Old Left"
 marxism_id_desc:0 "At the backbone of every society is a quiet set of hands making things work. The grand machinery of the Capitalist world cannot make as significant an impact without the ever present figure of the Worker. Toiling, burning body and soul to earn nothing but hardship, pain and devastation from the greedy, the foul and the incompetent above them. So workers of the World, Unite! We have naught to lose but our chains. It is time to remind the Bourgeoisie that the blood we share is Red."
 classical_marxism:0 "Classical Marxism"
 classical_marxism_desc:0 "Revolution is a nuanced thing, one that needs structure and understanding of the conditions of a given era. The revolutions of 1848 bore fruit in this sense, as Marx championed a new cause for the nascent left-wing of Europe, soon the red pennants will be held high, as the songs of camaraderie and international revolution will be sung loud and clear. The worker shall not be trampled on, for they are what keeps society afloat Hegel's triumph writ large on the Red of the Worker's movement."
 council_communism:0 "Council Communism"
 council_communism_desc:0 "Tyrants cannot be allowed to roam free, perverting the justice inherent to Socialist ideals, but neither can the stateless, a body without a head, bleeding from it's neck until collapse. And so, the solution is ultimately simple, a plurality, many voices, many people, the creation of the council, wherein all shall speak, all shall know and understand the works of the government. That must be the socialism that should be put forwards, as the commune is naught but an empty ruin without the work of the People."
 jacobinism:0 "Jacobinism"
 jacobinism_desc:0 "One of the first cries of the common people, synthesised in a melting pot of despair, anguish and a burning eagerness to burn down the cages of inequality constraining the will of the people. Robespierre's vision was blood-soaked, but enlightenment will follow in its wake. The people of the world shall prosper under the rule of the free! And as such, the free must be protected at every cost, from every side, such is the manner of our righteous crusade against the despot, the monarch, the noble."
 religious_socialism:0 "Religious Socialism"
 religious_socialism_desc:0 "The Divine exists on Earth. Extant and yet intangible, so would it not be right to treat the world justly? The gardens of Eden were never closed to us, nor were the field of reeds or Dilmun,they were obscured by our ignorance, the folly of Capital exploitation. We make and create with our hands, and so to deny the people partaking in holy creation, is the Greatest sin. After all, is it not the worker that works the land of divinity with his hands?"
 agrarian_socialism:0 "Agrarian Socialism"
 agrarian_socialism_desc:0 "The workers alone aren't the pillars of society, for what are feats of strength and mind without the food and energy with which to push them forwards? Revolution cannot be synthesised in the workers! It must be created within those that are the essential link in society, the farmers, the shepherd, they who create the foundational aspects of modern society, they are the bread and butter of a nation, both of which they too provide."
 syndicalism:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_desc:0 "The union of unions, working together in concord. Syndicalism is one of the many strategies that put the control of the state into the hands of the workers, at long last. As trade unions work together to propel their people to a better, brighter future. One where every worker is in ownership of the blood, sweat and toil that goes into the work they do. From Anarchist Syndicalists, to more parliamentary representation, the goal is ultimately the same. Society cannot be free when the workers are chained, nor can they be heralded by intellectual vanguards, the power must come from the Unions!"
 folk_socialism:0 "Folk Socialism"
 folk_socialism_desc:0 "The people are the lifeblood of Socialism, our hearts bleed red as any other man, woman, child or animal. We are all the creatures of nature come together to find solace in this cruel world, and so we must trust in the masses, trust in the people, the folk alone know the way forwards. Socialism must be ingrained in the people before it can change the world."
 conspiratorial_socialism:0 "Conspiratorial Socialism"
 conspiratorial_socialism_desc:0 "The bourgeois rulers of society, however degenerated and ill-suited to rule as they may be, still hold power over the masses, over the working people. The common worker is deluded, fully partaking in the various opiates that the masses are drugged with. They must be helped, they must be led to the light, carefully, so that they do not lapse back into the same reactionary rhetoric that they have been so heavily imparted upon by their rulers. The Revolution must be a silent cabal, dictating the will of the masses from the background. Only the silent dagger in the back can a revolutionary be, only by steering the worker can the bourgeois influences on society be eliminated."
 liberal_socialism:0 "Liberal Socialism"
 liberal_socialism_desc:0 "The world of the socialist is one that has the potential to become cruel. To impoverish more than it claims to want to sustain. To be critical of Capitalism is one thing, but to abolish it in it's entirety is a mistake that the socialists would be better off not making. The Markets are hubs of society, brimming with culture and artifice, the people compete, boosting innovation and thought. To completely defrock capitalism is to remove the parts of it that are helpful, that have allowed society to come this far. And so, Liberal Socialism must enchain Capitalism to the bulwark of the Socialist project, it must sand down it's abrasive edges, it's cutting inequalities, and create a market where all are able to pursue an equal degree of wealth. The world shall be shown how far it has come, and the Liberal Socialists shall be at it's forefront!"
 national_syndicalism:0 "National Syndicalism"
 national_syndicalism_desc:0 "The Communist speaks for the international, spreading the rhetoric of the Worker's movement across the globe, and yet he ignores the cries of the Worker at home. The Syndicalist degenerates into benighted anarchism, lacking discipline as chaos takes the fore. They forget the power that molded them, fashioned them into a tool for the change of society. The Nation alone is what allows for the syndicalist project to continue, who will protect the revolution? Who will systematise their changes? The state always remains, the benefactor, the keeper of national identity and spirit. For the nation, the workers must unite!"
 babouvism:0 "Babouvism"
 babouvism_desc:0 "As industry has marched on, ravaging the simple aspects of life with every step, the people find themselves torn away from the true socialist method. Before the march of the grand machines, the broken chords of industrial society, communism already existed. Within the people, the communities that the people built. The people must not be seduced by the false language of iron and steel, of soulless machinery, their eyes must be opened. They must see that the socialism of the earth, the communism that the high minded intellectuals speak of only pulls the common folk to slavery by a different leash, while the ideology they deem "primitive" will be victorious."
 barracks_communism:0 "Barracks Communism"
 barracks_communism_desc:0 "The Communist Struggle is a fleeting, hopeful, fragile thing, that is assailed from all sides. The forces of reaction, capital and those who are simply uninformed pepper the bulwark of the project. The proletariat must be mobilised, society must be broken down and rebuilt, every worker regimented, kept in line and formed in cadres of workers, moving ever closer to the glorious ideal of Communist. They must be militant, they must be frugal, and they must be fully dedicated to the Socialist cause. For it is with them that society can move past the clutches of the bourgeois scum."
 crony_socialism:0 "Crony Socialism"
 crony_socialism_desc:0 "Socialism is something to be pursued at any cost necessary. The party cadres may rot, they may be full of corruption and bureaucratic loopholes that treasure the upper party echelons instead of the people, but it will survive. Survival is tantamount in a world as perilous as this, with capitalist nations snuffing out the lights of more hopeful projects, all that will remain is the dark, the ooze, the scum and villainy on the bootheel of the Socialist Corpse. And yet, they will survive it all. They will not let scrupulousness bury them with the ideals of movements that couldn't keep them alive. Gangrene and cancer can be excised, parties may fall and parties will rise, but for them, the Socialists survive. No matter how battered, bruised, faustian and corrupt. They survive, and Marx weeps..."
 guild_socialism:0 "Guild Socialism"
 guild_socialism_desc:0 "Before there were unions, there were guilds. Entities where artisans learned from guild backed knowledge and refinement of their abilities to be the best example of their vocation they could ever be. Guilds as places of learning, and as proto-Unionism was a concept that the left should have salvaged from the burning, headless wreckage of the feudal system. Let a thousand new guilds form, as humanity finds a new world, with light, innovation and wonder. Do not let the march of time take this important artefact from the people!"
 mystic_socialism:0 "Mystic Socialism"
 mystic_socialism_desc:0 "Those who peer into the space behind spaces, weave the threads of nature and peer into the eyes of the divine and survive its burning touch know that the world is one. Some may view lives as passers-by, dying and returning gaining truths only they can see. Whilst others seek to climb trees of creation, communing with divinity at it's apex. Regardless, does humanity not deserve the fruit of thei spiritual labor? Do they not deserve the right to climb Yggdrasil's heights, or cross the Abyss? Are the meek and the common not permitted to scour the Enochian Aethyrs, like scores of ungainly, greedy aristocrats who simply take and take from society until there is nothing left? Knowledge, the fruit of spiritual labours, must be attained by all. Gnosis awaits at the end of the road, the path must be made visible. All must be enlightened, none must be left behind."
 sinclairian_democracy:0 "Sinclairian Democracy"
 sinclairian_democracy_desc:0 "Dictatorships remain tyrannical, despite the freedom espoused by the revolutionaries and the workers, Socialism is a spectre. A spectre haunting the world, scaring bourgeoisie and worker alike. The people do not know the gifts that Socialism gives! They do not know the freedom it provides! The name brings with it a host of fears visions of red tides of angry workers, revolutionary terror and a host of troubles. Instead, one must approach the people without the language of socialism, allow for open conversation, and show that despite the fact that the word "Socialism" causes fear, it is truly what they want."
 associationism:0 "Associationism"
 associationism_desc:0 "All things are inevitable, and with the collapse of the grand capitalist system forever looming in the future, one wonders what comes next? And while some look towards the pragmatism of worker's councils, others aim for loftier goals of allowing man to achieve what our God-given individual passions dictate. Free from the confines of terrestrial worries of wages, the mind can blossom into a glorious Compound Association. Coined by Charles Fourier, Associationism aspires to make a grand social machine that does away with all divisions, relying on a communal economy, society and social science to build a grand unityism."
 industrial_unionism:0 "Industrial Unionism"
 industrial_unionism_desc:0 "As the Gilded Age ground the working man into the dust, the question of how best to make a better world was met with a flurry of answers. The revolutionary ideas of Karl Marx spread across the world like a wildfire, and through the burning came new interpretations of that exact framework of worker's revolution. Industrial Unionism, espoused by such leaders as Daniel De Leon elect to enshrine the power in the hands of a trade unions. Intertwining syndicalist economic planning with fervent federal republicanism, the Industrial Union exists to defend the right to peace, bread, and to preserve our one big union."
 bellamyism:0 "Bellamyism"
 bellamyism_desc:0 "How much does a nation's principles reflect on its people? If people do not turn to the good book, where do they derive right and wrong from? Parents are fickle, society is flimsy, and faith wanes. But their country? Their country, right or wrong, can imbue them with more than any sermon could. Espoused by the brothers Bellamy and enshrined in their Nationalist Clubs at the turn of the previous century, Bellamyism instills a firm hand in patriotic, bordering on paligenetic nationalist pride, while embracing progressive outlooks on the role government plays in the day to day lives of its citizens. While it keeps a firm divide between the workings of government and the will of the people, it still never the lest stands for the rights of liberty, and justice for all."
 platformism:0 "Platformism"
 platformism_desc:0 "Who better speaks for the people, than the people? When the shackles of oppression are thrown aside and the people rejoice in the seizing of production, who else but the people should enjoy the fruits of their glorious revolution? When the Forty-Eighters stormed the houses of dusty kings, a spark was ignited in the minds of the people. From each according to their own ability, to each according to their needs. Inspired by the likes of Dézamy, Kropotkin and Proudhon, Platformism enshrines the commune as the basis for society, rallying to abolish the tyranny of private property, and preserve the glory of the people's freedom through labor management and direct action."
 peasant_republicanism:0 "Peasant Republicanism"
 peasant_republicanism_desc:0 "Of all the classes that are termed revolutionary, the worker only ranks second in line to that of the Peasant. The Peasant may seem brutish, crude and unrefined to the intellectuals of the left, but within each simple soul is a connection to something much, much greater. A popular will lies slumbering underneath the surface, where Peasants have understood that at the core, they are what makes or breaks a noble's livelihood. That kernel of radicalism lies there in the dirt of the humble family home, within the the desire paths stamped out by generations of feet walking hither and tither and quiet cottage taverns. The peasant will only need one threat to their life to mobilise, as King Louis XIV would come to realise."

 libertarian_socialism:0 "Libertarian Socialism"
 libertarian_socialism_desc:0 "Freedom was the aim of Marx, and yet Marx, like every other intellectual of his age fell prey to the seductive allure of the state. A vanguard, a dictatorship, it doesn't matter. Power corrupts absolutely, the revolutionary must never let the mantle of authority blind them, as authority is simply the shroud of the Oppressor. There is a long, long walk from here to freedom, a balancing act between calamity and treason. Autocrats, stuffing the pit with the bodies of those they promised absolution, find themselves tilting closer towards Calamity, or Treason. The libertarian socialist dream is built on fixing the errors of the vanguard, of building something new in the shell of the old. And every man, woman and child will be needed to build it."
 revolutionary_progressivism:0 "Revolutionary Progressivism"
 revolutionary_progressivism_desc:0 "Whiggish historiography claims that society is slowly, steadily moving towards a more enlightened, more just world. As incremental as these changes are, to let history take it's course without the right minds at helm is to doom society to periods of stagnation and reaction. How can a society progress forwards when the ethos of the age is pulled taut by reaction! Revolution alone will be what preserves the Whiggish conception of history, and revolution shall carry the echoes of the Enlightenment within it."
 philjacobinism:0 "Philosophical Jacobinism"
 philjacobinism_desc:0 "The revolution is not something that can be achieved solely within the span of a struggle. As revolutions rise, they eventually fall and become sublimated into a new status quo. This stagnation is the enemy of radicals everywhere! The people must continue the revolution in perpetuity, an eternal revolution. Critique of the conditions of all societies, over and over until every thread of the Old world is stamped out in a fiery blaze of progress. Progress at a sprint, the futurism of the new earth!"
 militant_communism:0 "Militant Communism"
 militant_communism_desc:0 "Grassroots organisation is the Communism of the future. After all, is it not through the amassing of funds, creation of groups and the strict adherence to cadres that the status quo, the predatory society that leeches the life, soul and blood from the common man falls? Revolutions run amok in the grassroots, for freedom divorced from the establishment is freedom of an intoxicating kind. Establishments, like all things, dislike intoxicants, they dislike the small freedoms that can be exerted by the Communism of the people. "Come and take it from us!" is the rallying cry, as the grasses bristle with the silver barrels of guns, peeking out at anyone who dare take freedom away."
 autonomism:0 "Autonomism"
 autonomism_desc:0 "Marxists claim a need to break from the traditional structures of capitalism, but in doing so they have created structures as oppressive as the capitalists use. In trying to break from tradition, they have allowed themselves to be bound to a different set of traditions, the tradition of party-lines, of attempting to integrate to the capitalist world, with its myriad structures and imaginary constructs and markets. Capital too has begun to adjust and take hold of these strategies, the worker begins to become predictable, unthinkably so! The truth of the matter is that the left-wing has sat on their laurels for too long, embracing the same kind of revolutionary strategy, whilst capital, ever the cruel and conniving trickster, makes adjustments to absorb these stabs at rebellion. The Autonomists provide an answer. Armed and spontaneous revolution, headless communism, mobilised by the workers, rejecting the trap laid within party politics and spearheading a movement from the streets. Where the face of revolution is the worker and the worker itself. Autonomous struggle. Armed joy and spontaneity."

 post_surrealism_desc:0 "Less a clear-cut ideology than it is a new philosophy of life and reality, Post-Surrealists have come out of a strange confluence of the French Ex-Left and the American Ex-Right, as Postmodernist theorists from both have come to hate the respective Spectacles of their home nations and those like them. Post-Surrealists believe in revolutionizing human experience in every corner of life and society possible, from the arts to politics to global relations."

One cannot move society as they do machines, with oil and simple commands, the human animal is much more complex than an automaton. They think, they feel, and love. Western Marxism rejects the robotic applications of Economic Marxism, for there is no reason to drag forwards a group that does not want to be pulled towards utopia. They must be taught, they must transform their culture in a way that lets the emplacement of Communism to be possible as the mind of man is twisted by the vagaries of capitalist thought.

Alas, the worker of this age is seduced by petty nationalist and ethnic fears, fears that the bourgeoisie have stoked to prevent one revolutionary stratum from accepting the other. And so, Black Marxism, or Afro-Marxism wages a quiet war, the neighbourhoods become the battlefields, the police blockade the enemy lines. The state is crude and unjust, and the only way that the African-American people can move forward is through the power of Marxism. And so they march forwards, to break chains invisible, to free all from the bourgeois grip."

Over and over again, there is a sense of futility in building a new world in the house of the old. Utopian dreams are twisted out of shape and out of character, until the ideals that they represented only exist on paper. Paper that soon will be relegated to the fires of collective amnesia. The revolution has failed, because we have failed to raze the foundations, unmake the world and clear the slate in it's entirety. The ruin seeks to pervert, to reassert it's control over the budding hopes of a new society. And for this, it must burn, the revolutionary must gut its corpse and and commit it to the fire, so that the maggots crawling within, insidious eaters of new flesh, can never find its way into the new order. Even if they possess some kernels of wisdom, expunge it regardless. The technology and knowledge of that age is whispering poison, it will be remade in the image of the new world, even if it requires stumbling towards it to even do so. It is only when the air clears and the ash from the burned bodies rises into the air that the true work of revolution can be begun. Until then, our war is against the old. The obsolete. The deceased."

Venerating thinkers like Zou Rong and Kita Ikki, it envisions enlightened monarchs and citizens leading nations, combining "socialism" with expansionist nationalism. It champions state-directed economic growth, moderating capital through heavy taxation, fostering national ethos, and territorial expansion. Distinct from Western capitalist individualism and Marxist class struggle, Imperial Modernism charts a unique course: uniting aristocratic heritage with egalitarian aspirations, and fusing enlightenment civil rights with imperial authority. Education and technology are lauded as twin engines for a modern, equitable, prosperous society. Externally, it's perceived as a distinctive "crowned State socialism"."

They can free their minds with the forbidden fruit of their labor and create new doctrines that steer them away from where the revolutions of the old failed. Narcotics can serve as a way to expand their group’s revolutionary thought while at the same time expanding the revolution’s revenue.

Workers of the world, abandon your God! That crude, effete figure balancing precariously on the shoulders of the wizened, senile priest.

The State-Socialist too is not spared from this, as their workers labour, being pushed to and fro by a hand not unlike the bourgeois scum that have ripped families from their homes, sold men and women into slavery under a different name and crushed the spirits of every human that has ever walked this earth. All that the State-Socialist has become is a Red Bourgeoisie, a tyrant in his own right. And so what is the antidote? What must be done? Revolution my friends. Revolution across every nation."

Born from those dissenters in the period who championed both the progress of the future and the values of the past, these young sons of Jefferson envision a nation, and a world brightened by the psychedelic sunshine of enlightenment, where the yeoman thrives, the student succeeds, the freaks storm the white house, and the corporate squares are drowned out by a sea of popular resistance. Because, after all, were the founders not the hippies and freaks of their century?"

 police_state_desc:0 "Sometimes the people just don't know what's best for them, and the greatest measures of security must be implemented. A police state is one in which authorities largely control civil life and liberties are restricted. Police presence and deployment play major roles in governance, as well as internal surveillance. Police states are almost exclusively totalitarian in nature, having almost no separation of powers or checks to party power. Originally just a common term for a civil administration government, the term now is used primarily as a derogatory term for states that restrict liberties and whose citizens generally live in undesirable conditions."
 noocracy:0 "Noocracy"
 noocracy_desc:0 "A system dating back to Plato's idea of a 'Philosoper King', a Noocracy is where the most knowledgeable rule. A complete rejection of the democratic process, these governments operate at the behest of experts, be them scientists, engineers, or sociologists. Access to the levers of power allow leaders to experiment in crafting a more perfect society through their genius. Whether they succeed is up to them alone."
 relnoocracy:0 "Religious Noocracy"
 relnoocracy_desc:0 "A variant of the classical Noocracy, Religious Noocracy follow the same basic guidelines as its secular counterpart in overriding the democratic process and maintaining a guided dictatorship of a board of experts. The key distinction is typically enshrining some level of religious officials in the positions versus mere "experts". For who else knows the ways of the world than those trusted elders of our sacred orders. Whether a cult, a new age religion, or a cabal of religious zealots clamoring to make the world better, the heavy hand of their individual rule guides themselves, and their people, to a glorious new day."
 dirigisme:0 "Dirigisme"
 dirigisme_desc:0 "A term coined by economists in response to the state planning of the French Jacobins, Dirigisme stands on the opposite side of the spectrum to Laissez-Faire economics.  Governments of this type use their influence to direct the markets away from disaster. This does not mean that Dirigisme is left-wing by any means. Its ranks stretch from strong arm populists seeking favor the people to the autocrats whose only wish is to create the most efficient economy on the face of the Earth."
 cryptocracy:0 "Cryptocracy"
 cryptocracy_desc:0 "Cryptocracy is a form of government that operates entirely away from the public eye. Typically operating behind the facade of a civilian government or other elected official. Cryptocracies can be made up of anything from wealthy capitalists to shady cabals and are usually seeking to control the populace or expand their own wealth and power.  However, the average citizen is unlikely to know of the shadow governments existence, with only a few skeptics and fringe extremists being able to gaze behind the curtain into the halls of true power."
 managerialism:0 "Managerialism"
 managerialism_desc:0 "Managerialism refers to a political system in which the government is controlled by and serves the interests of a select group of elite bureaucrats and officials. These individuals aim to maximize economic and governmental efficiency by micromanaging every aspect of society through the expertise of carefully chosen specialists. While they do not entirely ignore the needs of the populace, concerns for citizen welfare are merely factors within their broader programs. Citizens are primarily placated to prevent rebellion and ensure streamlined economic productivity. Although predominantly authoritarian, leaders of managerial states are typically chosen based on meritocracy rather than by raw power or social status. However, make no mistake — they can be just as cruel."
 institutional_dick:0 "Institutional Dictatorship"
 institutional_dick_desc:0 "Institutional Dictatorships are a form of governance where power is centralized not in a single charismatic leader, but within an entrenched system of organizations, bureaucracies, or ideological frameworks. These institutions maintain control through systemic structures rather than personalist rule, creating an appearance of stability, legality, and continuity. A vast, complex bureaucracy turns the gears of governance, enforcing control over various aspects of public and private life. It ensures loyalty through patronage systems and suppresses challenges by creating barriers to opposition. The concentration of power and lack of accountability often result in widespread corruption and abuse of power."
 social_corporatism:0 "Social Corporatism"
 social_corporatism_desc:0 "During the boom of the Industrial Revolution, and the explosion of wealth in the hands of entities beyond the state and specialist guilds, one question arose in how to best spend the income. While some elected to merely hoard the wealth, some of those new found elites elected for a pragmatic move of investing back into their community. Inspired by the likes of Rockefeller, Carnegie and Gillette, Social Corporatism is an interesting mixture of liberal economic politics with a focus on giving back to the community at large through the funding of social programs, improvements to society and large scale populism. All the while preserving their corporation, just behind the backdrop."

Ever since companies traded stocks for income, finances and the management of said finances have been critical to micro and macro economics. And states structured on this model have existed from the infancy of companies like the South Sea Company or the East India Company. Whether fiscally minded trade regimes, corporate aligned business parties or something more controlling, the market always prevails in the world of high finance and big business."

George Washington famously hated the idea of political parties, seeing them abuse and kindle the fears of the people and bend them to their wills rather than anything else. And this view lives on still in Washingtonian Democracy. A hierarchical and heavy handed approach to democracy that espouses personal liberties for the individual, evoking nationalist pride and restricting the vote in its own right. Balancing liberal populism with authoritarian pragmatism."
 synthesism:0 "Synthesism"
 synthesism_desc:0 "Originating from the works and beliefs of Julian Huxley, Synthesism lies as an infamous but sometimes 'effective' and syncretic government system. Believing in a form of highly centralized government in order to psychologically condition the population through actions such as eugenics, carrot and stick policy, and or societal stratification, all in an attempt to develop and evolve the people of the state, possibly to increasing levels/extents. While not all proponents, nor even Huxley himself, used the ideology to justify racism, a few believers of the ideology use the eugenics of the ideology in a "Race Realist" sense to justify racial eugenicism and exclusion."
 sociocracy:0 "Sociocracy"
 sociocracy_desc:0 "One of the greater repercussions of the modern capitalist system has been the difference between the haves and the have nots, and most modern philosophy elects to either alleviate this disparity, or enshrine a natural order in things. Sociocracy elects to run the middle course, enshrining the importance of not only the government in matters of economic planning, but that of the worker's unions and employer associations. A heavy focus is put as well on scientific management, in everything from residential planning, economic improvements and so on, to make sure the free market produces as much as it theoretically can."

Countless prophets have emerged, speaking of signs and revelations indicating the end of all things and the coming of a glorious new day, images of a world consumed by divine fire, war between the forces of Heaven and Hell, the twilight of the gods, or the annihilation of the universe itself. While innumerable failed predictions of Judgment Day have come and gone with humanity's myriad faiths, there are many who still maintain fear — and anticipation — for the End Times. Millenarian Theocracies are governments obsessively dedicated to preparing for such an end, consumed by delusions of grandeur and madness and typically controlled by a cultish inner circle with a prophetic figure at its head. Such states seek to transform society to ensure their populations are worthy of both surviving the coming storm and passing divine judgment, with many also engaging in hawkish and aggressive military action to hasten the coming eschaton."
