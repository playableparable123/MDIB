 ATK_Thems_Good_Eatin_desc:0 "For all of our people's history, our image has been tainted by our open practice of ritual cannibalism, something many in our nation still practice to this day, with no legal challenges towards them. This unsettling factor of ours has been conveniently ignored by the White man in his pasts pursuits, so long as we made dinner of the Spaniard and the Acadian rather than the Anglo, but as new millenniums swing in, we lose more and more of our prior support as the rest of the world moves past us. It's clear now we need a change of palette, or we'll be more starved than ever."

 ATK_Bayou_Brotherhood_desc:0 "Our little slice of what used to be Mexico is far from the only place the Atakapa people reside. Minor populations still live in isolated reserves in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and the Indian Territory. Our sense of nationhood and semi-statehood drives us towards unity with our far-apart family, and the topic of unity with them has been brought up in more and more discussions between our tribal councils."

 ATK_The_Old_Ways_desc:0 "Compared to the other reservations, we're an outlier in our firm adherence to our ancestors' teachings. Despite our adoption of French and English in limited circumstances, we keep our isolate language alive and well, we observe our oldest religious traditions strictly, and we maintain the same system of governance as we did hundreds and hundreds of years ago. There's very little resentment for this within the nation, and near-nobody wants these things to ever change."
