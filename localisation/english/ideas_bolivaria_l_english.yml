 JNG_The_Red_and_The_Black_desc:0 "While the Republic initially began as nothing more than another colonial project for the Criollo and Mestizo Aristocracy to further exploit the lands and peoples of the Andes and the Amazon, things have changed exponentially in the past few decades. Economic downturn and collapse in the 50's drove much of the elite straight back to Lima, as the Indigenous Peoples and Africans who stayed here worked to rebuild their nation, and in their image. Since then, our economy has recouperated, the White population remains lower than ever, and the Red Man and Black Man live in relative harmony, working towards the preservation our future and defense of our land."

 JNG_Run_Through_The_Jungle_desc:0 "One major side affect of our fluctuation in demographics and our mutual hostility with the Oligarchs in Peru is the increasing prevalence of Far-Left indigenist militants fleeing their persecution and seeking refuge within our borders. The overwhelming majority are peacable and have no ill will against the current administration, but their movements getting out of hand may lead us down a dark path to right back where we started. Our political advisors tell us we should do our best to sideline these groups while co-opting their tamer messages for our campaigning and platform."
 PRU_Ataypura:0 "Ataypúra!"
 PRU_Ataypura_desc:0 "The clock is ticking for us and our benefactors. For hundreds upon hundreds of years, Peru has switched hands between Caudillo and Capital, but it has always remained firmly Aristocratic and kept afloat by it's mercantile connections. A looming danger is lurking within our society, undermining our state and waiting to strike at the most precise moment. The American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, an openly Socialist, Radical faction spanning all the way from Mexico City to Cusco, supportive of the alarmingly violent and fringe ideology of 'Fascism', and openly defiant of our rule, is skyrocketing in popularity, and may only continue to do so should the economy worsen, or we take direct action to shut those nuisances down."
 PRU_Across_Ucayali:0 "Across the Ucayali"
 PRU_Across_Ucayali_desc:0 "While we already have the Jungle Republic to watch out for, an even more worrying enemy is that of our nextdoor neighbor, Acre. An even more ruthless model of business than ours, it's essentially become an unrestricted Petrostate, trigger-happy to send in their goons to secure any and all resources they desire. We've suffered the largest brunt of damage from this, as they continue to encroach on our territory, ignoring all of our warnings, verbal or violent. It's going to take either an impressive amount of diplomacy or the escalation of these skirmishes into an all-out war to put and end to this once and for all and put our nation back on track."

 ECU_Stuck_In_The_Middle_desc:0 "Firmly centered in the Equator, our nation is sandwiched between numerous conflictz, and always has been, yet through it all we have managed to maintain our neutrality and our prosperity. Our favorable trade relationship with the West and the rest of the Americas has been a staple, as we remain the continent's number one exporter of Cocoa and Coffee beans, our spot secured by the turmoil of our northern neighbour Colombia. Despite the establishment's intentions towards continued neutrality, many in our little nation desire that we lend support towards Colombia's government, as the prolonged warfare there may bring unwanted attention towards our northern border."
 ECU_El_Dorado:0 "El Dorado"
 ECU_El_Dorado_desc:0 "Out of any nation of South America, our relationship with the west has been, by far, the most favorable. Even since the accession to power of the British Israelites, the Empire still views us as a valued friend and trade partner. Similiarly so, the Dutch and the myriad of German and Italian companies who do business here adore us as we happily invite them in."
 COL_La_Guerra_Lenta:0 "La Guerra Lenta"
 COL_La_Guerra_Lenta_desc:0 "For decades Colombia has been rocked by civil conflict and chaos. After the conclusion of the initial civil war with the victory of the Conservative Party and its aligned militias, dissident forces entrenched themselves in economically downtrodden areas, and soon after took up open revolt against the state. With the official declaration of martial law in 1975, not long after the bombing of the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception by Anarchist Terror cells associated with what would later become the FRB. Now, Narco-Socialist druglords have taken root in the southern valleys, a loose federation of Anarchists have seized the capital, and on the border with Guayaquil, a European mercenary warlord has staked a claim of his own."
 COL_Prisencolinensinainciusol:0 "Prisencolinensinainciusol"
 COL_Prisencolinensinainciusol_desc:0 "For many, Colombia is a land of Confusion. Spanish speakers and speakers of Italian languages populate it in essentially equal amounts, but for almost the entirety of the country's existence, the government has enforced Spanish and denounced Italian, leaving the only monolingual Italian speakers in small, rural communities disconnected from greater society. This great linguistic divide is, according to some, the driving factor behind the nation's tearing apart of itself, historically and in the present. Whether that is true or not is up for debate, but one thing that is clear is that the majority of militants taking up arms are Italian speakers first, and openly promote the Italian language, recruit Italians, and champion their interests above all else. This sense of national unity is something unheard of in the mainland of Europe, but all to familiar to the ideological sons of Garibaldi and his lifelong companion Bolivar."
 MNH_Solidao:0 "Solidão"
 MNH_Solidao_desc:0 "Our dear Minho is the sole Lusophone American nation above Brazil, and in our relations with our neighbors we have consistently felt as strangers and aliens. To the West, the Colombians have disrespected our borders and spilt their bloodbath against the hull of our ship. To the East, the Dutch have robbed of us our old territory, and their hunger proves itself insatiable. To the South, rabid Indians taking up western guns and western ideologies rally against us in the name of "Libertad". Through all of this, our only recourse as a nation is self-reliance, and a strong bond with those who share our brotherly values."
 MNH_Irmandade_Nacional:0 "Irmandade Nacional"
 MNH_Irmandade_Nacional_desc:0 "The brave revolutionaries who took up arms and banners in the defense of our independence were, in their hearts, humble men with no other motivation than the safety and liberty of their land, family, and countrymen. Look to the north, to the land of the Yankee, and a very similar story is found. Since the era of President Monroe, we've kept amicable relations with the United States, particularly Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. In the exchanges of trade, culture, and language across the Caribbean and Atlantic, a distinct admiration has shone through the hearts of our citizens for the ideals of the American founders."
