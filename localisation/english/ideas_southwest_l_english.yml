 NVJ_Remnants_In_The_Southwest: "The Remnants In The Southwest"
 NVJ_Remnants_In_The_Southwest_desc: "A long time ago, there were hundreds of different tribes that called our chunk of Ne-he-mah home. And over the hundreds of years since the White Man arrived on our fair shores, they've all been whittled away down to our little coalition. The Navajo Nation encompasses the remnants of the Navajo, Hopi, Crit and Mojave peoples, rallied together in a small ball and handed nothing more than fry bread and a smile from our overlords in Washington. It's given our people a heartiness, but a deep and burning resentment of our neighbors."

 NVJ_Weaving_A_New_Age_desc: "The NTC, currently under the helm of Chairman Peter MacDonald have become more and more of a negative boon to our fair nation than anything else. Corruption under his regime is rather infamous, and many have been waiting for the moment he trips and takes the entire NTC out with him. In response, a series of pretenders to the Chairman have begun rallying beneath his seat on the throne. Should MacDonald's empire finally come undone, no one knows what the youth of the tribe have in store."
 NVJ_Lamanites_And_Lophophora: "Lamanites and Lophophora"
 NVJ_Lamanites_And_Lophophora_desc: "For a long period of time the Navajo Reservation has been split on matters of Faith. The Hopi and the Ute to the West generally follow the teachings of the LDS, as Nauvoo stood in the past as firm allies against the encroachment of the two budding nations' aggressive neighbors, while the Pueblo peoples to the East follow Catholic teachings infused with traditional indigenous faiths. To add to this rift, an uptick has risen in the past decades of followers of the Native American Church, a Syncretic, New Age religion coming out of Oklahoma, nicknamed Peyotism for it's followers frequent partaking of the plant in religious ceremonies. While the NTC remains neutral on the issue, increasing backlash from both Eastern and Western tribes are pulling the Reservation apart even further."
 NAU_Holy_Zion: "Holy Zion"
 NAU_Holy_Zion_desc: "It was the American gentiles who drove us from New York, Indiana and all the way to our new Nauvoo. It was their soldiers who lynched our founder, drove us to this place and it was here that we constructed our new home. We have faced many trials and tribulations here, and have slain as many of the white man as red to eke our holy land. While we may work under their combined banner, let it be said that Nauvoo and Ogden do not work entirely with our 'allies' in government. They shun us, and we in turn shun them."
 NAU_Wrinkles_In_Scripture: "Wrinkles In The Scripture"
 NAU_Wrinkles_In_Scripture_desc: "One byproduct of the rather loose interpretations of how one hears the word of God has lead the Mormon faith, and by proxy Nauvoo down a path of a hundred heresies. Variations of our faith have spread like wildfire almost every generation, and while the Church hasn't been keen on stamping them out for the sake of the collective state, they're a simmering problem. Even more so as the Church continues onward, and another group of our holy flock ascend to Heaven and pass the torch down to the next."
 NAU_Sodomites_In_Temple: "Sodomites In The Temple"
 NAU_Sodomites_In_Temple_desc: "While many don't dare cross into our holy land, there are a few who have stuck around in our fair state. Some are heirs to old empires that haven't been too keen on staying entirely within the church, or those who wish to do more than simply follow the word of scripture. And others are complete foreigners who've simply elected to set up shop and peddle more than the word of God. While they're a problem, we cannot fully bring the hammer down. There's too many internal issues to drive the moneylenders from the temple just yet..."
