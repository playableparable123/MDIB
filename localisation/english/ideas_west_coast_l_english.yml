 CAL_Curbing_The_Rest: "Curbing The Rest"
 CAL_Curbing_The_Rest_desc: "Governor Curb has been dancing the dance of the a million different voting blocks these last four years. Playing the conservative against the Peace and Freedom Party, the pragmatsts against Baran's technophiles and the liberal against Feinstein's Feds, his administration has been one of the better ones in the history of our fair State. It's also one that still suffers bubbling issues from the north, south, east and west. Instability from the Bay Area and Los Angeles, constant cries from Rural Libertarians and a myriad of small fires waiting to catch the brush alight."
 CAL_New_Age_Retro_Hippies: "New Age Retro Hippies"
 CAL_New_Age_Retro_Hippies_desc: "In our land of possibilities, the idea of something as mundane of faith has millions of interpretations. Our relatively lax approach to the topic of religion has allowed a myriad of different religious organizations to get a good foothold in the state of California. While some of these are benefits aren't problems at all, such as the Jesus Freaks of San Fran, others with less noble intentions have taken advantage of this policy to make their own little circles. From the bowels of hell in the Bay Area, to the badlands of the Spahn Ranch."

 CAL_Audit_Of_The_Century: "The Audit Of The Century"
 CAL_Audit_Of_The_Century_desc: "Los Angeles's curious cultural hallmark, the Church of Scientology has been a topic of debate for a good few years now following their chain of lawsuits across the rest of the wider United States. While other states have brought the hammer down hard on the followers of Hubbard, the Californian response has been much more markedly tepid. True, they're gracious benefactors of the Republican Party, but some mutter about some deeper level of a connection in our state apparatus. These repressive persons must be kept on a short leash, lest they get out of hand."
 VEG_Frank_Rosenthal_Show: "The Frank Rosenthal Show"
 VEG_Frank_Rosenthal_Show_desc: "People can say other things control Vegas, from those that don't know claimin' the Mayor does, or more pithy metaphors about vice and greed. But take a walk down the strip and you know who calls the shots. Lefty Rosenthal does, that's who. Even through his front, Rosenthal and the Commission are out there, front and center with Las Vegas's daily operations. While a benefit for the locals and anyone on the take, anyone who falls outside of their purveau knows how ruthless the Commission is. And rumblings on the inside tell you that not all is good inside the Stardust."
 VEG_Bought_Found: "If It Can Be Bought, It Can Be Found"
 VEG_Bought_Found_desc: "Las Vegas's economy is primarily based around two things. The extraction of money from the hands of suckers at the craps table, and a myriad of businesses made to hide that money from the eyes of the rest of the US. While a never ending form of income, it's not one that's ever been geared to anything but luxury goods. Take a walk a few blocks from the strip and you'll be bombarded with pedantic luxury goods from Cadillacs to diamond rings. And once you get farther than that, desert. Heavy industry has never been Vegas's forte, and that's a budding problem as sales slack in the Hacienda."
 VEG_Final_Sin_Stupidity: "The Final Sin"
 VEG_Final_Sin_Stupidity_desc: "Some called it ironic that, following his indictment in 1973, that the honorable Barry Goldwater would flee all the way to Las Vegas. Not a surprise, given the second largest return on investment for the Free City is lax tax policy, so many corporations find themselves at home in sham offices. But not for Goldwater, no sir-ee. The New Libertarian Party has called itself home for a decade, and every chance they get, they throw their hat in the ring of Vegas politics. While a noble counter to the Mafia's open faced corruption, Vegas has gotten them some less than savory allies."
 NEV_Tropical_Hot_Dog_Night: "Tropical Hot Dog Night"
 NEV_Tropical_Hot_Dog_Night_desc: "Despite the best attempts of the other state parties, the Magic Party has become an iconic chunk of the Silver State's political structure. Beefheart's coalition of weirdos, wackjobs and musical miscreants won the hearts and minds of the state, even against the slow decline of Nevada's economy. But not all is good in the organization. Those in the know are aware of Don's medical issues, and talks have begun of him stepping down before the coming election. The question of who replaces him is at hand..."
 NEV_A_Scrambled_Opposition: "A Scrambled Opposition"
 NEV_A_Scrambled_Opposition_desc: "Ever since the loss of Las Vegas, the state of Nevada has been in a death spiral economically and socially. In that void of desperation, policies were taken to attract any business that could help right the ship. Reno and Carson City are hotbeds of a fragmented and only vaguely whole response to this conundrum, ranging from the remnants of the gambling committees, industrialists, forwardists and more who are ready to help salvage what remains of our state. Should they be given a chance, that is."
 ORE_Packwoods_Problems: "Packwood's Problems"
 ORE_Packwoods_Problems_desc: "Governor Packwood has become one of the most divisive governors in Oregon history, ever since the invoking of martial law following the 1984 outbreaks of salmonella across the state. Having failed to fully sedate the Rajneeshi threat, his coalition of like minded Oregonians is becoming thinner and thinner as time goes on. Relying mostly on allies in the Oregon State Police to remain afloat, there's a ticking timebomb under his foot for how long he can keep his coalition of public safety going before the people revolt against him."
 ORE_Wild_Wild_Country: "Wild, Wild Country"
 ORE_Wild_Wild_Country_desc: "Wedged far away from Salem, the interesting contradictions that is the Rajneeshpuram religious movement have proved to be a thorn in the side of our good state. Having snuck into our quiet interior, they've become a popular destination for the spiritually lost to find themselves yet again. And yet they're more than another wack job hippie cult. Heavy importation of arms and equipment, combined with their fanatical loyalty to their guru Osho has made them hard to move. We must deal with this before they're able to fully organize and march on the capital."
 ORE_I_Want_My_MTV: "I Want My MTV"
 ORE_I_Want_My_MTV_desc: "Kids these days have a phrase, much to our annoyance. 'Keep Portland Weird'. Kept at arms length from Salem and the good people of the state, Oregon's larger city has become a hotbed of alternative artists, creative types, foreign interlopers and more. Organizations like the Itano Institute and the Pacific Artists and Musicians Union have made that city their home, and routinely run err against anything we do. Eyes must be kept on that town of hacky sacks and bead bracelets, lest they get too uppity."
