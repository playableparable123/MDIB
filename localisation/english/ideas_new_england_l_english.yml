 NHM_Splendid_Isolation: "Splendid Isolation"
 NHM_Splendid_Isolation_desc: "Ever since its foundation, New Hampshire has been known and loved for its idyllic natural beauty. A slice of an older America that's nominally presumed lost to time and history, the state government has been extremely hawkish in preserving it. While various state parks have helped keep the state green, it's left it a tad economically behind its neighbors of our Massachusetts, New York and even Connecticut. The tourist economy for ski lodges can only keep chugging for so long."
 NHM_Heirs_To_Failure: "The Heirs To The Failure"
 NHM_Heirs_To_Failure_desc: "Once thought dead following their failure in the 1850s, the issues of Ephraim have driven hundreds of thousands of Irish across the ocean like the olden days. And those who wish for the freedom of their homeland have found the silence of New Hampshire a fantastic place to prepare to repeat history. These militias are small for now, but they can easily overwhelm us if we aren't careful."
 NHM_Fairies_In_The_Forest: "Fairies In The Forest"
 NHM_Fairies_In_The_Forest_desc: "Driven up north by legislative reprisals following the Stonewall Riots, the gay rights group Stonewall Nation has become a somewhat welcome but odd inclusion in the New Hampshire sphere. While some of their leaders are accepted and even gaining popularity against the Commonwealth Party, it houses some more radical elements in their ranks. While we can't clamp down on them, we need to watch them carefully."
 NYK_Dance_Of_The_Sachems: "The Dance Of The Sachems"
 NYK_Dance_Of_The_Sachems_desc: "Ever since the 1850s, New York politics have been wrapped up in the machinations of political machines. Governor Corning and Tammany Hall have been good allies ever since the late 1940s. Even with the strain of recent years, the two sides of the political coin remain dancing in perfect rhythm. For now..."
 NYK_The_Apples_Core: "The Apple's Core"
 NYK_The_Apples_Core_desc: "New York City has always outshone the rest of the state, but in recent years a certain rot has begun to fester in the Big Apple. The Appalachin Meeting exposed to America how far the Mafia has entrenched itself, and even with their flight to Las Vegas, they still hold some sway in New York City proper."
 NYK_This_Aint_The_Mud_Club: "This Ain't The Mud Club"
 NYK_This_Aint_The_Mud_Club_desc: "Like our friends across the pond in London, the New York City club scene has become a cesspit for the discontent. Underground political organizations have coagulated in the clubs of the city, from Manhattan all the way to Long Island. Freaks, Queers, and God knows who else waiting for their chance to step out of the night."
 MAS_The_Rock_Of_America: "The Rock Of America"
 MAS_The_Rock_Of_America_desc: "For the state of Massachusetts, heritage is more important than anything else. It was in Boston that the first inklings of independence was stoked, it was in Lexington and Concord that the first shots of the Revolution were fired. Even to this day, the state has stood as a shining example of an America that's been lost to time. For better, and for worse."
 MAS_The_Crucible_Of_Progress: "The Crucible of Progress"
 MAS_The_Crucible_Of_Progress_desc: "While Massachusetts hasn't entirely denied the advancement of the modern world like some of their neighbors, there's a definite divide between the idealistic nostalgia of the state government and the reality of life in the Commonwealth. Calls for reform feel to fall on deaf ears, and that's driven some to start looking elsewhere for it. Straight into the hands of radicals, waiting for a chance to strike out."
 MAS_The_Madmans_Gallery: "The Madman's Gallery"
 MAS_The_Madmans_Gallery_desc: "A thorn in the side of our just and merrie Commonwealth, Eric Esoterick has become more than a mere curator of art. Courtesy of his flagrant attacks against the status quo of Massachusetts, he's endeared himself to a wide amount of the youth, outcasts and radicals who want to dispose of the tenants of our fair state. These radicals need to be kept on a short leash, before they come out and tear us to shreds."
 CCT_Sea_To_Shining_Sea: "From Sea To Shining Sea"
 CCT_Sea_To_Shining_Sea_desc: "While many of our neighboring states have long lambasted us for maintaining West Connecticut given a lack of a proper connection, the wealth of the Lehigh Valley has kept the coffers of Hartford chugging for decades now. But the Commonwealth below has been grumbling about trying to reclaim what they lost, and the treaties that allowed us to march to defend it before haven't been updated in a while..."
 CCT_Common_Law: "Common Law"
 CCT_Common_Law_desc: "Formed in 1830 by the Grand Conference of Waterbury, the Connecticut Commonwealth Party has managed to weather almost 150 years of strife with little issue, representing the whole of the state under one roof. While some call it nothing more than set dressing for a one party dictatorship, the truth couldn't be farther from reality. Industrial lobbies, creative elites and so on make their home in the CCP, which is as much of a benefit as it is a hazard."
