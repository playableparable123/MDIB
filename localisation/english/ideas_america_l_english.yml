 TheAmericanCentury_desc: "With the unification and centralization of the United States. Many political thinkers have started to throw around the idea of the "American Century". The idea that the United States will be the next great power in the world, acting as the shining beacon of liberty that the founding fathers envisioned.

Obviously the continuation of Congress has resulted in dozens of impeachment attempts on the sitting president, most of which have been shut down through brute force of the executive branch. Curb has only recently started to extend an olive branch to Congress to negotiate the return of free elections and a new system of government for the more centralized America he envisions."
