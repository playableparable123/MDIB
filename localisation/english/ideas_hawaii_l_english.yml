 HAW_Paradise_Lost: "Paradise Lost"
 HAW_Paradise_Lost_desc: "For a good while, Hawaii was a nation-sized vacation for pompous and proud Brits and Yankees alike. The native culture was something exotic to ooh and aah at. The Pearl of the Orient, a magnificient, peaceful hermit kingdom, where nothing could go wrong. FOr the past few years that hasn't been it's reputation, exactly. The resignation of the King after the revelation of his connections to the Maui Three, and the parliamentary hellstorm it wraught, gave the go-ahead to the Royal Navy stationed in Hawaii to take over full-force. It should've been simple from there, but the greed and megalomania of Prince Andrew, not particularly fond of the BI establishment back at home, led him to proclaim himself king instead, taking complete control of the isles with his mostly-loyal cadre. From then on, the storm of trouble has been ever-brewing as native dissidents ramp up their rebellion and continue to organize, the dysfunctional and corrupt clique of Andrew's maintaining a feint illusion of control."

 HAW_International_Businessman_desc: "Dashing looks. Flawless charm. Tenacious wit. Andrew is, no matter what, a powerful personality, and with him he brings along a slew of privileged gentleman equally as two-sided as himself. Investors from New York, Mercenaries from Coabana, Royals from England. There are just as many men around him who worship his very aura as there are men liable to stab him in the back as soon as he makes the wrong move. Needless to say, if he isn't careful, his reign isn't going to last very long."
