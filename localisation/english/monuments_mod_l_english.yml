 GLOBAL_MONUMENTS_HELP_TEXT: "§YMonuments§! \nMonuments are located in specific states. A state can have multiple monuments and a monument can only be present in one state. Monuments give the §Cowner§! of the state they are in specific bonuses, if he meets the monument's requirements. \n\n§YMonument Types§! \nThere are two types of monuments: §Y$GLOBAL_MONUMENTS_TYPE_ARCHITECTURE$§! and §Y$GLOBAL_MONUMENTS_TYPE_NATURE$§!. $MONUMENT_NATURE_TT_DELAYED$ \n\n§YLevels§! \nEach monument has one of four possible levels: \n   - §C$MONUMENT_LEVEL_NAME_DESTROYED$§! / §C$MONUMENT_LEVEL_NAME_NOT_BUILT$§! (§Y0§!) \n   - §C$MONUMENT_LEVEL_NAME_NOTEWORTHY$§! (§Y1§!) \n   - §C$MONUMENT_LEVEL_NAME_SIGNIFICANT$§! (§Y2§!) \n   - §C$MONUMENT_LEVEL_NAME_MAGNIFICIENT$§! (§Y3§!) \nEach level grants stronger bonuses than the one before. The level of §Y0§! usually does not grant any bonuses. \n\n§YBuilding & Upgrading§! \nIf the owner fulfills the monument's requirements, he can build or upgrade it. This costs £pol_power£ §Y$POLITICAL_POWER$§! and takes time, both can differ depending on the monument itself as well as its level and state or country modifiers as well as whether the state is a core of its owner or not. \nThe building or upgrading in progress is called §Yconstruction§! and is displayed in the §Y$STATE_MONUMENTS_HEADER$§! interface, in the §Y$GLOBAL_MONUMENTS_CONSTANT$§! and in the decisions tab. It can be canceled manually in the former two or will automatically cancel if the owner loses ownership or control over the state or if he stops fulfilling the monument's requirements. \nA country can have a maximum of §Y5§! monument constructions at the same time. \n\n§Y$GLOBAL_MONUMENTS_CONSTANT$§! \nThis window shows all monuments that currently exist on the map and shows lots of information about each one. Those include the image, the name, the description, the state it's located in as well as its owner, its level and status and its effects. Some of those information as well as the bonus requirements can be seen when hovering over the image. \nIt also includes lots of filter options to filter the large list of all monuments to exactly those that you want to take a look at. Closing the §Y$GLOBAL_MONUMENTS_CONSTANT$§! resets the filter for the selected country to yours. \nTo quickly reset all filters, you can use the §Y$GLOBAL_MONUMENTS_RESET_TEXT$§! button. \nFor performance reasons the window is not updated constantly, however it is updated everytime a button inside it is clicked or if monuments change (e.g. if they lose or gain a level). \n\n§YSpecial Monuments§! \nWhile they function exactly like all other monuments they are special in one thing: They do not exist at the start of the game, but are put into a specific state via decision. This is the case for monuments that are technically not in the timeframe of the normal game (e.g. §Y$MONUMENT_63_NAME$§!) or monuments that in reality never existed but were planned by some nations (e.g. §Y$MONUMENT_28_NAME$§! and §Y$MONUMENT_64_NAME$§!). \n\n§YAI Usage§! \nAI nations get the bonuses of monuments just like human players do. And they will also build and upgrade monuments; however, to ensure that they will prioritize other things first (like changing laws), AI nations need to have at least §Y[?global.ai_monuments_pp_threshold?300|0]§! £pol_power£ to consider investing into monuments.\n"
