 AST_Buggered:0 "A Buggered State of Affairs"
 AST_Buggered_desc:0 "It's been a hard fifteen years, there's no point in beating around the bush. Sure, we won the Ferdinand War and kept our hold on the state, but our economy has yet to properly recover and the veterans are yet to be compensated. We've maintained a decent relationship with Ephraim, but they're not helping keep our neighbors at bay from stomping their way to the ACT. In short, we need to find our own way to sort our issues out before things get even more buggered up..."
 AST_Eureka:0 "A Long Way From Eureka"
 AST_Eureka_desc:0 "The Eureka Rebellions that exploded all over the Riverina and a few other parts of our nation back in 1851-1875 was a call to our 'masters' in London that this patch of land filled with Convicts, Miners and other vagabonds wasn't going to accept any more of their harsh taxes, corrupt administration or the lack of autonomy each state and territory had. Finally, in 1880, they listened to us and let us form our glorious Confederation... and as much as we'd like to say we've moved on from those days, you'll still find the Eureka flag flying over some old gronk's house. 'One day we'll fly it again!' They say, sitting on their lawn chairs in their dry yards. 'One Bloody Day!"
 AST_Billabong:0 "Billabong's a Bubblin..."
 AST_Billabong_desc:0 "Originally, our divisions were rather simple. We'd have state against state and Sydney Against Melbourne. But now? Young wankers are going up against old gronks over the matter of the natives, politics and our status in the world. The calls for a complete federalisation or a return to a closer alliance with Ephraim are growing. The  aboriginals are starting to get bolder, and the fucking poofs in the cities are rousing up stranger and stranger ideas. It's getting crazier here, and if this election don't fix it, then there's going to be trouble we can't fix over a few esky beers..."
 AST_Sinclair:0 "Sinclair's Diemens"
 AST_Sinclair_desc:0 "Ian Sinclair would've been happy to finish his term as PM as a 'supposedly' crooked politician who just managed to upset the Sudaustralians once again. But since '83 any plans for that are long gone... much like Van Diemen's Land. When those bloody pagans, hippies and satanists managed to convince everyone of that mostly-dutch rock to separate from the Confederation on the grounds of 'Spiritual freedom from the Demon Prime Minister'... and the fact that it passed through parliament was a miracle for them. For Sinclair? A nightmare. Ephraim still calls him up on when the 'eventual reclaimation plans' are gonna happen... and his own cabinet are beginning to lose their patience with his 'biding of time'. Not to mention, the public's divided reactions have only caused more flak for him. When the election season begins, he's going to leave this in the hands of his VP and enjoy an early retirement. Maybe then, they can exorcise the 'Diemen' out of the 'Diemen's Land', har har."
