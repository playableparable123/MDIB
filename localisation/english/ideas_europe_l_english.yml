 BRG_Tradcath: "État Catholique et Royal"
 BRG_Tradcath_desc: "Despite our rich history and culture, the modern state of Burgundy exists for a single reason: Counter-Revolution. When the Jacobin terror marched from Paris to the rest of France and Europe, our noble people could not stand idle while the very foundational pillars of France were toppled in favor of the corrupted values of "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity." Like our brothers in Vendée, we launched our own insurrection to restore France to what it always was; Catholic and Royal. \n However, to our dismay, the armies of Satan, greater in number, stalled our advances at the Rhône. Despite liberating the lands of Arles, we were unable to push further into the rest of France. So here we stayed, safe in the mountains and guarded by our allies in Vienna. The Jacobin menace has yet to launch a campaign against our state, but if they do, we will ensure the last remnant of True France does not fall in their hands."
 BRG_Problem: "A Very Burgundian Problem"
 BRG_Problem_desc: "Like the previous independent Burgundian state, the status of our Duchy, and the Duchy itself. is often a source of confusion, frequently baffling national and international observers. The Duchy of Burgundy is, since 1815, de jure held by the Emperor of Austria, which would, on paper, make us a vassal of the Austrians. However, Burgundy itself can hardly be considered a Duchy, as the title of Duke, de facto held by Louis III, is not mentioned at all in our recently revised constitution, fruit of radical republicans gaining more and more ground in our state and, surprisingly, having the support of the Duke himself, with his only stipulation being that he retain his hereditary title. \n As a result, Burgundy is often referred to as a Duchy out of convenience, but in practice, it defies classification as either a Duchy or a Republic, a status quo who stirs discontent among every political faction of our duchy - if it can even be called that."
